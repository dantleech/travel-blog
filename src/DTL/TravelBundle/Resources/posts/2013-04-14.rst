I have now been in Lagos in the Algarve for almost a week, or maybe more,
maybe less. I have eaten the same breakfast at the same time for 7 consecutive
days. Groundhog Day. The television is routinely turned on at 20:00 and the
same MTV schedule is played over every night. Every night the same programs,
and the same music is played in the reception.

Some different people have been and left - first there was the frech guy,
Walter, with whom I conversed with for 4 days before he left, then there was
the out-of-luck Carlos with no money to stay another night, so I paid for
another night, and he didn't stay. Then there were the Germans last night and
a mad, but harmless, French guy, who talked to himself and made scenes. A
quiet old man with a meek expression sites quietly in the courtyard with a
beer.
